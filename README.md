# AMW_for_submit

The branch has been revised to display the simulation and real data analysis component for the paper titled "Augmented match weighted estimators for average treatment effects."

The "simulation" file consists of two sections: "amws" and "amwds." The former pertains to scenarios with extreme propensity scores, while the latter focuses on situations with nonextreme propensity scores. The "real_data" file  consists of code and data we use for real data analysis.


The R package "dsmatch1_1.0.0.tar.gz" is based on the [dsmatch](https://github.com/Yunshu7/dsmatch/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) with some modification to get 
the numbers of matches K. 

I will update seperate package for AMW in the future.
